        </div>
        <p>At this point, being into memes is hardly a rare thing for someone my age, but this is due to the massive cultural explosion during 2015-2016 when literally everyone started sharing memes. The problem I had with it though, is that a lot of the 'memes' being shared, especially on Facebook and Twitter (but not Reddit) were not funny at all and could barely be described as memes, these are <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=normie%20memes">Normie</a> memes.<br>
        The kind of memes that have minions in them, or an unironic use of the crying-laughing emoji, the kind of memes that make you cringe so hard that you want to bleach your eyes, so that you never see such a bad meme again.</p>
        <p>Enter the world of Dank Memes<br>
        Imagine a style of comedy that can transcend most facets of society due to it being either, absolutely meaningless and bizarre or <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meta-meme">meta</a>, ironically badly produced, dark and horrifying, or anything else for the most part that can be described as (simply put) strange, and you have a dank meme. A simple and quick explanation but it is much more complicated than that.</p>

          <h2>4chan and SJWs</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Ever since ~2014, mainstream culture has been infiltrated by people known as
          <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Social%20Justice%20Warrior">Social Justice Warriors</a>
          , who obsess over the ideology of politcal correctness. You see it with late night talk show hosts, celebrities, movie directors, journalists, the list goes on and on.</p>

        <p>The best way to describe Social Justice Warriors is that they're people who claim they're fighting against social injustices, but are actually doing nothing other than
          <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Virtue%20Signalling">virtue signalling</a>
           to validate their own ego and further their own agenda, common beliefs of these people are that somehow minorites can't be racist, women still earn less than men for the same work, by default (which has been made illegal already) and many more idiotic beliefs.</p>

        <p>They are usually millennials that have been to college and university and have been brainwashed into believing extreme political rhetoric, usually far-left, whenever they are confronted by someone of an opposing viewpoint they usually refuse to have a rational discussion with said person in order to find common ground and agreement, and instead just call them terms such as 'Racist', 'Nazi', 'Fascist' etc.</p>

        <p>To give an example of a Social Justice Warrior organisation, there is one called 'Antifa' (short for anti-fascist), inspired by the organisation of the same name in Germany during 1932-1933 (part of the Communist Party of Germany). This organisation puts the original to shame; simply put, they are the biggest hypocrites in the world.</p>

        <p>In keeping with the tradition of refusing to have rational discussion, these people take it a step further and resort to violence against anyone who doesn't have the same opinion on any topic. The ironic part of this organisation's agenda is that they're the fascists, and any google search for
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fascism&rlz=1C1CHMO_en-GBGB886GB886&oq=fascism&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l7.1447j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Fascism</a>
          proves that, as they resort to intimidation and violence against anyone who has an opposing viewpoint, so you can see why they are hated so much, even left-wing people that I know hate them.</p>

          <p>Allow me to introduce you to 4chan, a message board site on the weird side of the internet, full of... quite strange people, two of these message boards are /pol/ (politically incorrect) and /b/ (random). These people hate Social Justice Warriors and will do anything to
            <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Triggered">trigger</a> them, and I mean <em>anything</em>, they will embody the worst kind of degeneracy known to mankind if it meant they could trigger some SJWs.

              <h2>The triggering of Shia LaBeouf</h2>
          </div>

      <p>Shortly after
        <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The%20great%20meme%20war">The Great Meme War</a>
        , Shia LaBeouf had the bright idea of setting up a 24/7 webcam-show in which the participants were normal New York citizens who would just chant the words 'He Will Not Divide Us', in reference to the approximate 50% of the US population that were displeased with the election outcome... which is extremely ironic.</p>

      <p>Remeber that message board site, 4Chan? Shia didn't...<br>
         Within hours of the show starting, people from the /pol/ and /b/ boards started showing up with the intention of trolling and triggering as many people as they could, which turned out as you'd expect.<br>
         During the show, in a rage Shia sexually assaulted one of his own supporters who he mistook for one of the trolls and was promptly arrested and deported to his home state. Afterwards, the site had a fence set-up which only allowed 5 people in at a time. A wall... if you will :) and ironically they had divided themselves.</p>

      <p>Shortly after the <a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-NgEQE4YjHII">first Shia-4Chan incident</a>, Shia decided to setup another livestream with the same spirit as the first, it was a camera feed in the middle of nowhere, facing a flag that read 'He Will Not Divide Us', it was impossible to find out where it was and therefore nothing could stop it, checkmate 4Chan. Or so Shia thought.</p>

      <p>Members of /pol/ accepted this obvious challenge to find the flag, they started to gather as much information as they could about the environment from the feed, tracking cloud patterns as-well as wind and ambient sound, and since it was a live-stream, they could find out the time-zone the flag was in by waiting until the sun set on the stream, which narrowed it down to the eastern part of the US.</p>

      <p>Some members began looking into where Shia was at the time, because it was very likely that he was present for the flag being raised and was probably still nearby, next the stream showed 2 faint jetstreams, which gave /pol/ the idea of mapping the flight paths in the Eastern seaboard but they couldn't identify any of it yet. At approximately the same time /pol/ members found a post from a waitress who couldn't keep her mouth shut about meeting him, in Greenville Tennesse, and according to the members looking at the flight paths, 2 planes were set to fly over the town and if they were spotted on the stream, it would confirm that the flag was in Greenville. The planes were spotted on the stream... :)))))</p>

      <p>To further narrow it down, /pol/ members began to chart all of the flight paths of spotted planes on the stream in a hope to triangulate the area, but they still needed more information, and at night time they got it.<br>
      /pol/'s 'Austronomy' division began to use the constellations to narrow down the bearing and rough position of the camera, this narrowed the search area down by a tonne, further information was gathered from a /pol/ member who drove around the area and honked the horn and was told when he was getting closer or further from the camera, until... finally, it was found.</p>

      <p>Upon confirmation of the flag's exact position, /pol/ members began to work on a way to get to the flag in the dead of night without being discovered, take the flag down and replace it with something that would trigger Shia. After a few hours, thousands of people (including Shia presumably) watched in amazement as the flag was taken down and replaced with a pepe shirt and MAGA hat connected together. The whole operation took only 38 hours and 14 mintues, and poor Shia was divided yet again.</p>

      <p>Thus began the widespread knowledge of the internet rule: don't mess with 4Chan, never under-estimate what they call 'weaponised autism'.</p>
