          <p>I have always found history to be fascinating, because it is full of characters that could be ripped straight out of a fictional novel, but they did exist, which is amazing to me... some of the feats achieved by these historical characters would leave most people in awe.</p>

      <h2>Alexander the Great of Macedon</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The Ancient Kingdom of Macedon or "Makedon" in Greek pronunciation, was one of the major powers during both the Classical and Hellenistic Periods within Greece, known at the time as 'Hellas'. People from Macedon were known as Macedonians or "Makedonikoi".</p>
      <p>What made them so effective in battle was the famed 'syntagma', a type of phalanx formation, in which the first 5 rows of the 256 man unit outstretched their 20ft pikes called Sarissas.
      This made it impossible to engage the unit in melee combat from the front and come anywhere close to winning, however it was weak at the flanks and extremely slow.<br>
      Because of this, the usual Macedonian army consisted of a long line of Syntagmas supported by hoplites on either flank who used shorter and more agile spears, as well as heavy cavalry, some of which being the kings personal household guard, and javelinmen, peltasts, slingers and archers.</p>
      <p>An extremely famous historical hero from Macedon was 'Alexander the Great', and his nickname truly lives up to godlike feats that he achieved during his life.</p>
      <p><img class="context-image" src="resources\css\img\Alexander.jpg" alt="Alexander the Great on horseback"></p>
      <p>Without getting too much into his backstory, when he became King he inherited (from his Father, Philip II) leadership of an alliance called the Hellenic League, which allied all city states of Greece apart from Sparta and with the help of his huge army, marched towards Asia with the goal of destroying the nemesis of the Greeks, the Persian Empire, it is also worth noting that in every battle he fought against the Persians, his army was woefully outnumbered.</p>
      <p>After 10 years of campaigning he achieved victory over the Empire and in the process became not only Basileus of Macedon and Hegemon of the Hellenic League, but also; Lord of Asia, King of Persia and Pharoah of Egypt.</p>
      <p>Alexander also founded many cities during his conquests of the Persian Empire, he founded Alexandria in Egypt and many others. He also created a piece of land to act as an undestroyable bridge when beseiging a fort within the Persian Empire, few men have ever changed geography for the purpose of gaining a fortress.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, he was a ferocious warrior, a fearless and charismatic general and a genius strategist and one of the greatest Greek heroes of all time, and what some may call an 'Absolute Mad Lad'. In fact, the tactics that he employed in battle are still studied and taught to strategists to this day.</p>

        <h2>King Leonidas of Sparta</h2>
        </div>
        <p>When most people hear anything about Sparta, they usually envision 300 totally unrealistically ripped dudes wearing basically nothing apart from a helmet, cape and underwear.</p>
        <p><img src="resources\css\img\spartans unrealistic.jpg" alt="Spartans from the Movie '300'" height=400 width=700></p>
        <p>In reality, Spartans wore the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite">'hoptlite'</a> armour, which most of the time, consisted of a bronze helmet, chesplate, vambraces, greaves and shield, as well as using an iron spear and a short sword called a Xiphos.</p>
        <p>Most people know about the Battle of Thermopylae (literally meaning 'hot gates'), where the King of Sparta, Leonidas and his 300 Spartans held off a persian invasion for days and displayed stubborn-ness that  even infuriated the Persian king, Xerxes, who was known for being patient.</p>
        <p>In real life there were probably around 7-10 thousand Greeks against the Persian army, and most of them were actually not Spartan, instead many Thebans and Athenians as-well as troops from other cities joined the fight. The reason the Spartans became the highlight of the battle is that, of the estimated 3,000 Spartans that were part of it, 300 (including Leonidas) stayed behind to delay the Persians for at least another day as they knew the position was about to be surrounded, plus Leonidas knew that if he were to die in battle, then Sparta would officially go to war, which is exactly what he needed since a religious holiday was on-going at the time of the Battle which forbade them from going to war unless they were in dire circumstances.</p>
        <p>A year after the battle, a giant army of allied greeks banded together and fought the Persian army at Plataea, near Athens and completely destroyed them.</p>
        <p>Had Leonidas not stayed behind, not only would he have been a coward king, but it could have meant Sparta didn't go to war, at least until much later, giving the Persians enough time to fully occupy Greece. It's ironic that the actions of a King ended up causing a chain of events that would make sure that democracy survived, as at the time, Athens was the only democratic state in the world, or at least resembled modern Democracy very closely, the main differences being that women can now vote and slaves were still present, who obviously couldn't vote.</p>
        <p>I think it goes without saying that King Leonidas rivals Alexander in his greatness, not through his intelligence or tactics, but through extreme bravery and courage and an indomitable will to fight to the end. Because of this, he is also one of my favourite historical heroes of all time.</p>
