      <div class="col span-1-of-3">
      <p>I'm sure most people have seen this formula before, but not many would understand just how important it was at the time that Albert Einstein 'invented' it, basically it proved that energy and mass are interchangeable, as they are clearly both proportional to eachother, as c<sup>2</sup> is a constant (9 x 10<sup>16</sup>m/s).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col span-1-of-3">
      <p>Another equation for energy is E = h/f, this means that the energy of something without mass (light) is Planck's constant (6.63 x 10<sup>-34</sup>m<sup>2</sup>kg/s) divided by the frequency of the light wave. This equation allows us to find the other units for energy, kg.m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <p>Confused yet? I was too in A levels all the time, once you understand something, you move onto something even more confusing, and before you know it you have to convert your brain into a repository of knowledge just to answer one exam question.</p>

      <h2>Black Holes</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col span-1-of-3">
    <p>Most people know about black holes these days, but the way they are usually interpreted is still pretty incorrect. People seem to think that the black sphere IS the thing that is pulling in everything that gets too close, but this is simply the radius at which light cannot escape the singularity at the centre, this is known as the event horizon.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span-1-of-3">
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, if the sun were to be a black hole, nothing much would happen, sure the Earth would freeze over quite quickly but all the planets would still orbit perfectly, although Mercury <em>may</em> get sucked in, but that's really it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col span-1-of-3">
    <p>You can actually tell whether an object will become a black hole by calculating it's Schwarzschild radius and comparing it to it's actual radius, any object with a radius smaller than it's Schwarzschild radius is a black hole, for example if the Earth were somehow crushed into something with a radius of 8.7mm, it would become a Black hole.</p>

        <h2>Magnetars</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col span-1-of-3">
      <p>Magnetars are similar to pulsars, except they have an extremely strong magnetic field and quite possibly spin even faster. This magnetic field can be around a million times stronger than the field that Earth creates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col span-1-of-3">
      <p>For example if you were to enter a star system with a similar size to our own, and at the centre there was a magnetar a similar size to Sol, you would immediately be vapourised once you got to a similar orbit distance as Neptune, this is because the iron in your blood would be ripped out.</p>
