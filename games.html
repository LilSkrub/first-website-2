      <h2>Stellaris</h2>
    </div>
    <p><img class="context-image" src="resources\css\img\stellaris screenshot.jpg" alt="Most complicated game on Earth" width=960px height=540px><p>
    <p>It's as complicated as it looks, I've owned the game for around about a year now with ~500hrs and I've only recently become any good at it :))))))))))</p>
    <p>The easiest way to describe Stellaris as a game, is that it's a 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit and Exterminate) grand strategy game set mostly in space, including many sci-fi concepts like terraforming, space battles, wormholes, Dyson Spheres and Ring Worlds (think Halo). There is no objective to the game other than the one you set for yourself, and of course not losing. You can choose from a list of default governments or create your own, you could choose to play as a democracy that prides itself on egalitarianism and xenophilia, or be the exact opposite and play a militaristic, authoritarian and xenophobic despotic empire, which is more fun as you can go on a xenocidal killing spree :))</p>
    <p>Although most people play it as a singleplayer game, multiplayer is available, and as long as other people have the exact same mods that you have, they can join your game. Me and my cousin have been playing an ongoing multiplayer game and it is arguably alot more fun than the singleplayer, because a human makes for a better military ally than a stupid AI, even if said human barely knows that they're doing.</p>

      <h2>Rainbow Six: Siege</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The concept behind Rainbow Six Siege is very simple, what if operators from special operations forces from all over the world practised their skill against eachother in realistic situations such as bomb defusal and hostage rescue, sounds serious, right?</p>
    <p>WROOOOOOOONG!</p>
    <p>The game is an absolute cesspool of toxicity and degeneracy, which is why it's so fun to play, because making people angry over the internet is arguably one of my generation's most treasured pass-times.</p>
