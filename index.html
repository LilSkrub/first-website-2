        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      </div>
    <p>
    As for some general things about me; I'm a 20 year old college student who tried to do A level IT, Physics and Maths in 2016-2018 but didn't do very well (DEE respectively) due to some unanticipated events, I have still retained my interest in IT and Physics though.
    After those 2 year courses, I decided to do a 2 year BTEC IT course at the Manchester College and so far i've enjoyed it alot more than I did my A level IT course, because it had no content related to programming or hardware, and to be honest it was more like business than IT.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would say that I'm quite good with programming and computers, by this I mean that I know quite a bit about computer hardware and as a result I have custom built my home computer since 2014, upgrading individual parts as the years went by, it sounds like i'm bragging but it really isn't that difficult, any idiot with access to the internet can watch a video in which the process of installing a CPU, Graphics Card or RAM is explained in detail, all you have to do is research the parts that you want and make sure that they: fit your budget, have the best performance for price and are compatible with eachother.
