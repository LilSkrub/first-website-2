      <h2>Bing Bang Bong your music taste is wrong</h2>
      </div>
      <p>I grew up listening to mostly rock, punk and pop punk as a kid, I listened to bands such as Queen, Bon Jovi, Paramore, AC/DC, Guns n Roses as well as many other similar bands and artists. But as I grew older it was apparent that I was more interested in music with loud guitars and fast drums, and the typical radio music annoyed me to no end. So, as a result (and probably to the dismay of many of my elderly relatives) I started to get more and more into loud music as I grew older.</p>
      <p>When I was in secondary school, I began listening to metal bands like Metallica and Slipknot, which I think was the gateway to what I mostly listen to nowadays, which has taken the metal scene by storm; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore">Metalcore</a>. This genre apparently had a very bad reputation until around 2014 when alot of bands began to pull off the genre really well, some examples are; Architects, Jinjer, Northlane, Polaris, August Burns Red, Wage War and Parkway Drive as well as many more.</p>
